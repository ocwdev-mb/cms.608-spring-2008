1st Essay: Research a Historical Game ({{% resource_link 167451ab-ae9a-6fa1-2944-d8eef3f43ed8 "Examples" "#first_essay" %}})
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Find a game that is at least 100 years old. Analyze it by applying the topics and methods that we have discussed in class. Play the game with friends or classmates and make any changes to make it playable today, if necessary. Document any changes that you made to the game, and of course playtest them.

In the paper, you should analyze the game and address your playtest process—what problems you came across and how you tried to solve them; what the outcomes of your playtesting were; how changes in the rules generated different dynamics and if these created a different experience. Make references to the class readings and use the terminology and techniques introduced in class.

In your paper, do not forget to include the original game rules, the outcomes of your testing, and any amendments you made. Diagrams are encouraged. 1000-1500 words. Due in Lec #7.

2nd Essay: Design a Clubhouse Game Variant ({{% resource_link 167451ab-ae9a-6fa1-2944-d8eef3f43ed8 "Examples" "#second_essay" %}})
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Design a new variant of a classic clubhouse game (e.g. Cribbage, Poker, Bridge, Blackjack, Rummy) playable using a standard poker deck and chips. Applying the topics and methods that we have discussed in class, playtest the game extensively and document any changes that you made to the game. Investigate similar variants, if any, and aim to create something unique.

In the paper, you should analyze the game and address your playtest process—what problems you came across and how you tried to solve them; what the outcomes of your playtesting were; how changes in the rules generated different dynamics and if these created a different experience.

Remember! Make references to the class readings and use the terminology and techniques introduced in class.

In your paper, do not forget to include the different versions of your game rules, the outcomes of your testing, and any amendments you made. Diagrams are encouraged. 1500-3000 words. Due in Lec #16.

1st Team Project: Adapt a Non-Board Game ({{% resource_link 167451ab-ae9a-6fa1-2944-d8eef3f43ed8 "Examples" "#first_team_project" %}})
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In teams of 3 or 4, design a board game that's an adaptation of a non-board game, e.g. sports, game shows, videogames, card games, or playground games. Your game may require between two to four players. If it can accommodate a variable number of players, state any rule changes necessary for different-sized groups. You may use up to five six-sided dice. You may require the players to provide up to six different colors of generic, identically-shaped tokens in any quantity. (We will test your game by having six different colors of beads on hand.) If your game requires play money, recommend the quantity of denominations of the currency for an ideal number of players. Your submission should include your game rules, token/dice requirements, game board, and any custom cards submitted in hardcopy and PDF format. Due in Lec #25.

Your submission should also include a paper between 1500 and 3000 words. Applying the topics and methods that we have discussed in class, playtest the game extensively and document any changes that you made to the game. Analyze the game and address your playtest process—what problems you came across and how you tried to solve them; what the outcomes of your playtesting were; how changes in the rules generated different dynamics and if these created a different experience.

Remember! Make references to relevant class readings and use the terminology and techniques introduced in class.

2nd Team Project: Design an Original Game ({{% resource_link 167451ab-ae9a-6fa1-2944-d8eef3f43ed8 "Examples" "#second_team_project" %}})
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

In teams of 3 or 4 students, design a game to meet the following constraints:

*   Use every tool and process introduced this semester to come up with an original game!
*   State an aesthetic goal in the first week and attempt to design for it. (The game can evolve towards other aesthetics through testing and iteration.)
*   The game must be playable in a small room, like a regular classroom.
*   New players must be able to understand the game and complete a full game in a total of 30 minutes.
*   Your game must be playable by three or four player groups. State any rule changes necessary for 3-player or 4-player groups.

Your submission should include your game rules (separate from your essay), a list of token, card, or dice requirements (if any), game board (if any), and any custom items and cards submitted in hardcopy and PDF format. Due in Lec #38.

Your submission should include a single team-written paper between 1500 and 3000 words. Applying the topics and methods that we have discussed in class, playtest the game extensively and document any changes that you made to the game. Analyze the game and address your playtest process—what problems you came across and how you tried to solve them; what the outcomes of your playtesting were; how changes in the rules generated different dynamics and if these created a different experience.

Remember! Make references to relevant class readings and use the terminology and techniques introduced in class.

In your paper, do not forget to include the different versions of your game rules, the outcomes of your testing, and any amendments you made. Diagrams are required.

### Components

*   The game can be a board game, a card game, a live-action game, or it could just require players, tables, chairs, and rules.
*   If you create or use custom components, they must be submitted with your assignment, and they will not be returned.
*   You may require the players to supply up to five six-sided dice and to provide up to six different colors of generic, identically-shaped tokens in any quantity. (We will test your game by having six different colors of beads on hand.)
*   If your game requires play money, recommend the quantity of denominations of the currency for an ideal number of players.
*   You must provide any other kinds of randomizing devices, game items, or tokens.

### Deadlines

*   Send the instructors your intended aesthetic by Lec #34.
*   Be prepared to blind-test your game during the final workshop. You must have your rules written in a form that would be understandable to a completely new player. Have all your rules and all game components before we start the workshop session.
*   The final paper is due in Lec #38, before we start the class. Submit it to us via email and bring a hard copy with all your game components so that the class can play the game during lecture.
